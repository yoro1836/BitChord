/**
 * One OkHttp client for the whole app.
 *
 * This matters: googlevideo binds a stream URL to the connection context of
 * the `player` request that minted it. If Innertube and ExoPlayer used
 * separate HTTP stacks they could resolve to different addresses (v4 vs v6)
 * and the media fetch would come back 403. Sharing the client keeps DNS,
 * address family and connection pooling identical for both.
 *
 * That sharing has a cost the defaults don't budget for. Every request the
 * app makes — [Innertube]'s player/browse calls, NewPipe's own signature and
 * `next`-endpoint fetches, [ChunkedDataSource][com.music.bitchord.playback.ChunkedDataSource]
 * and [AudioCache][com.music.bitchord.playback.AudioCache]'s multi-megabyte
 * chunk downloads, and every [StreamResolver] probe — funnels through this
 * one client, and OkHttp's stock [Dispatcher] allows only 5 requests in
 * flight to a single host at a time. A track streaming while its successor
 * pre-caches is two or three of those requests already; a resolve running
 * alongside them queues behind whichever is occupying the rest — invisibly,
 * since a request stuck in OkHttp's queue and a slow server both just look
 * like a request that took several extra seconds. Sized well past anything
 * this app actually drives concurrently, so the queue is never the reason a
 * request was slow.

    // Added to answer, with real numbers instead of code-reading, which of
    // this app's network callers actually account for the reported data
    // usage (issue #48): every request funnels through this one client, so
    // a network interceptor here sees every byte the app receives,
    // regardless of which subsystem asked for it. Categorised by host —
    // googlevideo.com is YouTube's own audio bytes (and StreamResolver's
    // probes, distinguishable by their small actual read against a 2MB
    // Range ask), a canvas provider's CDN is motion artwork, youtube.com /
    // youtubei is API/extraction traffic. Grep logcat for "BCDataUsage"
    // during a play session; each line is one response with its actual
    // transferred bytes and the running total for its host.
    //
    // Left in place rather than deleted — the investigation this served is
    // not the last one this app will need — but off by default: flip to
    // true only while actively measuring. Wrapping every response body in a
    // counting source and writing a log line per request is not free, and
    // paying that on every install for a question already answered is the
    // wrong trade.
